**This code is a test release. All code, features and documentation are subject to change and may represent a work in progress**

## Building the source

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the [Installation Instructions](https://test-zond.theqrl.org/install).

Building `gzond` requires both a Go (version 1.20 or later) and a C compiler. You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make gzond
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```

## Executables

The go-zond project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd`
directory.

|  Command    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :--------:  | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`gzond`** | Our main Zond CLI client. It is the entry point into the Zond network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Zond network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. Based on gzond, `gzond --help` and the [gzond CLI page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/command-line-options) show command line options. |
|   `clef`    | Stand-alone signing tool, which can be used as a backend signer for `gzond`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|  `devp2p`   | Utilities to interact with nodes on the networking layer, without running a full blockchain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  `abigen`   | Source code generator to convert Zond contract definitions into easy-to-use, compile-time type-safe Go packages. It operates on plain [Zond contract ABIs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) with expanded functionality if the contract bytecode is also available. However, it also accepts Solidity source files, making development much more streamlined. Please see the [Native DApps](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/dapp-developer/native-bindings) page for details.                                  |
| `bootnode`  | Stripped down version of our Zond client implementation that only takes part in the network node discovery protocol, but does not run any of the higher level application protocols. It can be used as a lightweight bootstrap node to aid in finding peers in private networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|   `evm`     | Developer utility version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that is capable of running bytecode snippets within a configurable environment and execution mode. Its purpose is to allow isolated, fine-grained debugging of EVM opcodes (e.g. `evm --code 60ff60ff --debug run`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `rlpdump`   | Developer utility tool to convert binary RLP ([Recursive Length Prefix](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/rlp)) dumps (data encoding used by the Zond protocol both network as well as consensus wise) to user-friendlier hierarchical representation (e.g. `rlpdump --hex CE0183FFFFFFC4C304050583616263`).                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Running `gzond`

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please see our nascent [Zond Testnet docs](https://test-zond.theqrl.org) or consult the
[gzond CLI Wiki page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/command-line-options)),
but we've enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly
on how you can run your own `gzond` instance.

### Hardware Requirements

Minimum:

* CPU with 2+ cores
* 4GB RAM
* 1TB free storage space to sync the Mainnet
* 8 MBit/sec download Internet service

Recommended:

* Fast CPU with 4+ cores
* 16GB+ RAM
* High-performance SSD with at least 1TB of free space
* 25+ MBit/sec download Internet service

### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `gzond` binary, you can also pass a
configuration file via:

```shell
$ gzond --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea of how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to
export your existing configuration:

```shell
$ gzond --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```

#### Docker quick start

_Docker deployment in development_

One of the quickest ways to get Zond up and running on your machine is by using
Docker:

```shell
docker run -d --name zond-node -v /Users/alice/zond:/root \
           -p 8545:8545 -p 30303:30303 \
           zond/client-go
```

This will start `gzond` in snap-sync mode with a DB memory allowance of 1GB, as the
above command does.  It will also create a persistent volume in your home directory for
saving your blockchain as well as map the default ports. There is also an `alpine` tag
available for a slim version of the image.

Do not forget `--http.addr 0.0.0.0`, if you want to access RPC from other containers
and/or hosts. By default, `gzond` binds to the local interface and RPC endpoints are not
accessible from the outside.

### Programmatically interfacing `gzond` nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you'll want to start interacting with `gzond` and the
Zond network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, `gzond` has built-in support for Ethereum-compatible, JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/)
and [`gzond` specific APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc)).
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `gzond`,
whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
you'd expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
  * `--http.api` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `zond,net,web3`)
  * `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
  * `--ws.api` API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `zond,net,web3`)
  * `--ws.origins` Origins from which to accept WebSocket requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcapi` API's offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: `admin,debug,zond,miner,net,personal,txpool,web3`)
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `gzond` node configured with the above flags and you'll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
Zond nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
APIs!**
