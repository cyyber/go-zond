This directory contains accounts for testing.
The password that unlocks them is "foobar".

The "good" key files which are supposed to be loadable are:

- File: UTC--2024-05-27T07-48-33.872599000Z--Q7dc77ecc04feebb45f6f9b878d2eed271d1a17a5

- File: zzz

The other files (including this README) are broken in various ways
and should not be picked up by package accounts:

- File: no-address (missing address field, otherwise same as "aaa")
- File: garbage (file with random data)
- File: empty (file with no content)
- File: swapfile~ (should be skipped)
- File: .hiddenfile (should be skipped)
- File: foo/... (should be skipped because it is a directory)
